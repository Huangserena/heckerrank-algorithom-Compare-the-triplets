# heckerrank-algorithom-Compare-the-triplets
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.  We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .  Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a0 with b0 , a1 with b1 , a2 and  with b2.  If a0>b0, then Alice is awarded  point. If b0>a0 , then Bob is awarded  point. If a0 = b0 , then neither person receives a point. Comparison points is the total points a person earned.  Given A and B , can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?
